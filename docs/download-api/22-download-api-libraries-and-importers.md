# Download API – Libraries and Importers

Sketchfab maintains importer widgets and references to third-party libraries that can consume glTF/GLB or USDZ content.

## Importer widget

- Sketchfab provides a downloadable importer widget to help integrate downloads into apps.
- Use it to streamline authentication and download flows rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Libraries

- Use standard glTF loaders (e.g., three.js) for web scenarios.
- USDZ is natively supported on iOS; other platforms may need a USDZ-capable loader.
- A community list of importers and libraries is referenced in Sketchfab’s developer resources.

## Notes

- Respect model licenses when importing or redistributing assets.
- Behavior and available widgets may change; check the official Sketchfab documentation for updates.
