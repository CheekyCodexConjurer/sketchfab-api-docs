# Status and Maintenance

This repository is an **unofficial, community-maintained** reference. It reorganizes publicly available Sketchfab information for easier consumption by humans and LLMs.

## Update cadence

- Updates are ad hoc based on community contributions.
- Expect lag behind the official Sketchfab documentation.

## Verify against official sources

- Official developer site: https://sketchfab.com/developers  
- Data API reference: https://docs.sketchfab.com/data-api/v3/swagger.json

Before implementing or deploying features:

- Recheck endpoints, parameters, and behaviors on the official site.
- Validate authentication requirements (some features require OAuth).
- Confirm rate limits and download URL expirations.

## How to help

- See `docs/meta/91-contributing.md` for contribution guidelines.
- Open issues or pull requests with corrections and updates.
